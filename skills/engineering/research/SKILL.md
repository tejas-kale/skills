description: Investigate a question against high-trust primary sources and capture the findings as a Markdown file in the repo. Use when the user wants a topic researched, docs or API facts gathered, or reading legwork delegated to a background agent.
---

Spin up a **background agent** to do the research, so you keep working while it reads. On the spawn, set `model` (or the harness equivalent) to that harness's **mid-tier** — Claude Code `sonnet`, Codex `gpt-5.6-terra`, Cursor a `*-fast` slug; otherwise the provider's mid-tier or fast alias. If you are already the research agent, execute the job below yourself.

Its job:

1. Investigate the question against **primary sources** — official docs, source code, specs, first-party APIs — not a secondary write-up of them. Follow every claim back to the source that owns it.
2. Write the findings to a single Markdown file, citing each claim's source.
3. Save it where the repo already keeps such notes; match the existing convention, and if there is none, put it somewhere sensible and say where.
