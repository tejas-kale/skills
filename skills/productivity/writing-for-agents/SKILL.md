Write any document an agent will consume: a skill, an `AGENTS.md` or
`CLAUDE.md`, or a doc reached by a pointer. The packaging differs. The writing
does not. The same levers make each one predictable. The agent takes the same
_process_ every run. The output can still vary.

When the document is a skill, read [`SKILL-MECHANICS.md`](SKILL-MECHANICS.md)
for frontmatter, invocation choice, and router skills.

When you write the prose of that document, read
[`../../local/plain-writing/SKILL.md`](../../local/plain-writing/SKILL.md) and
apply that voice. `plain-writing` is user-invoked, so this file points at the
markdown. The agent cannot discover `plain-writing` on its own.

## Context pointers

A **context pointer** is a reference held in the agent's context. It names some
out-of-context material and encodes when to reach it. A skill's description is
one. A line in `AGENTS.md` that names a doc is the same object. The pointer's
_wording_, not its target, decides when the agent reaches the material, and how
reliably. A must-have target behind a weakly worded pointer is a variance bug.
Sharpen the wording first. Inline the material only if sharpening fails.

A pointer does two jobs. It states what the material is, and it lists the
**branches** that should trigger reaching it. A branch is a distinct case the
document handles, so different runs take different paths through it. Every word
of an always-loaded pointer costs on every turn, so it earns even harder
pruning than the body.

- **Front-load the leading word.** The pointer is where it does its triggering
  work.
- **One trigger per branch.** Synonyms that rename a single branch are one
  branch written twice. Collapse them and keep only genuinely distinct
  branches.
- **Cut identity the body already carries.**

## The two loads

Every document and pointer you add spends one of two budgets.

**Context load** is the cost of always-loaded material on the agent's window:
an `AGENTS.md` line, a skill description, anything sitting in context every
turn, spending tokens and attention whether or not it fires.

**Cognitive load** is the cost on the human: which documents exist and when to
reach for each. The human is the index. This is the price of human agency.
Spend it where human judgement matters. Remove it where it does not.

Material reached only through a pointer escapes context load at the price of
the pointer's own line. Material with no pointer at all rides entirely on
cognitive load.

## Information hierarchy

A document is built from two content types that mix freely: **steps** (the
ordered actions the agent performs) and **reference** (definitions, rules,
facts consulted on demand). All steps is a recipe. All reference is a review's
rules, or this skill. The core decision is where each piece sits on the
**information hierarchy**, a ladder ranked by how immediately the agent needs
the material.

1. **In-file step.** The primary tier: what the agent does, in order.
2. **In-file reference.** Consulted on demand. Often a legitimately flat
   peer-set (every rule of a review on one rung). That is a fine arrangement.
3. **Disclosed reference.** Pushed out into a separate file, reached by a
   context pointer, loaded only when the pointer fires. Spans a sibling file in
   the same folder through fully external reference that lives anywhere and any
   document can point at.

Push too little down and the top bloats. Push too much and you hide material
the agent actually needs. That tension is the whole decision.

**Progressive disclosure** is the move down the ladder, out of the main file
and behind a pointer, so the top stays legible. It is how the hierarchy is
protected, not primarily a token optimisation. Branching is the cleanest
disclosure test: inline what every branch needs, and push behind a pointer what
only some branches reach. When a document has steps, in-file reference that
should be disclosed buries them and turns attending to them into a coin-flip.
That is a variance lever, not only a legibility one.

**Co-location** is the within-file companion. The ladder decides how far down a
piece sits. Co-location decides what sits beside it once there. Keep a
concept's definition, rules, and caveats under one heading rather than
scattered, so reading one part brings its neighbours with it. The test: the
document should read like documentation written for the agent. Grouped material
reads that way. Scattered material does not. Duplication repeats one meaning in
two places. Scattering fragments one meaning across many.

**Sprawl** is a document that is simply too long, even when every line is live
and unique. Attention thins across the excess, and every extra line is one more
to keep relevant. The cure is the ladder: disclose reference behind pointers,
and split by branch or sequence so each path carries only what it needs.

## Steps and completion criteria

Every step ends on a **completion criterion**: the condition that tells the
agent the work is done. Two properties make it a lever.

**Clarity.** Can the agent tell done from not-done? A vague bound
("understanding reached") invites **premature completion**: ending the step
before it is genuinely done, attention slipping to being done. The visible
steps still ahead, the **post-completion steps**, supply the pull. The
criterion's clarity is the resistance. Defend in order: sharpen the bound first
(local and cheap). Only if it is irreducibly fuzzy and you observe the rush,
hide the later steps by splitting the sequence. Hiding only works across a real
context boundary (a hand-off or a subagent dispatch). An inline call leaves the
later steps in context and clears nothing.

**Demand.** How much it requires. "Every modified model accounted for" forces
thorough work where "produce a change list" does not. Demand drives
**legwork**: the digging the agent does within the work, latent in the wording
rather than written as its own step. Demand is not step-bound. "Every rule
applied" binds a body of flat reference just as "every step done" binds a
sequence. That is how an all-reference document still carries an exhaustiveness
bar.

The strongest criteria are both checkable and exhaustive.

## When to split

Splitting one document into two spends one of the two loads, so split only when
the cut earns it.

- **By sequence.** Split a run of steps where the post-completion steps tempt
  the agent to rush the one in front of it. Keeping them out of view drives
  more legwork on the current task. The reverse also holds: merging sequences
  exposes each step's later steps to what follows, inviting premature
  completion.
- **By invocation.** Skill-specific. See
  [`SKILL-MECHANICS.md`](SKILL-MECHANICS.md).

## Leading words

A **leading word** is a compact concept already living in the model's
pretraining that the agent thinks with while running the document (_lesson_,
_fog of war_, _tracer bullets_). Repeated as a token, never as a sentence, it
accumulates a distributed definition and anchors a whole region of behaviour in
the fewest tokens, by recruiting priors the model already holds. Coining your
own works if you define it clearly, but a made-up word recruits no priors. You
pay in definition tokens what a pretrained word gives free. Reach for an
existing word first.

It anchors twice. In the body, _execution_: the agent reaches for the same
behaviour every time the word appears, and inside flat reference it focuses
attention on a class of thing to look for. In a pointer, _invocation_: when the
same word lives in your prompts, your docs, and your codebase, the agent links
that shared language to the material and reaches it more reliably.

Hunt for opportunities to refactor with leading words. A triad spelled out at
three sites, a pointer spending a sentence to gesture at one idea: each is a
passage begging to collapse into a single token.

- "fast, deterministic, low-overhead" → _tight_ (a _tight_ loop).
- "a loop you believe in" → _red_. A fuzzy gate becomes a binary observable
  state. The loop goes _red_ on the bug, or it doesn't.

You win twice: fewer tokens, and a sharper hook for the agent to hang its
thinking on. Assume every document is carrying restatements that leading words
retire. Go find them.

**Negation** is the failure mode beside this lever. Steering by prohibition
drags the forbidden behaviour into context and makes it more available, not
less. Prompt the **positive**. State the target behaviour ("write one-line
comments") so the banned one is never spoken. A prohibition earns its place
only as a hard guardrail you cannot phrase positively. Even then, pair it with
the positive target so attention lands on what to do.

## Pruning

Keep each meaning in a **single source of truth**: one authoritative place, so
changing the behaviour is a one-place edit. **Duplication**, the same meaning
in more than one place, costs maintenance and tokens, and inflates a meaning's
prominence on the ladder past its real rank. That is the accidental inverse of
a leading word, which repeats a token on purpose, never the meaning.

The **environment** is a source of truth too: `package.json` scripts, config
files, the directory layout, `--help` output. A document that restates it is a
**cache**: a copy of a lookup, earning its load only when the lookup is
expensive. Cache what the agent cannot find by looking: the unwritten
convention, the reason behind a choice, the gotcha no config confesses. Leave
the one-file, one-command lookups to the environment, where they cannot go
stale.

Check every line for **relevance**: does it still bear on what the document
does? A line loses relevance by never bearing on the task (mere exposition, or
a branch that should be disclosed) or by going stale as the behaviour or world
it describes changes. Shorter documents are easier to keep relevant. Without a
pruning discipline the default fate is **sediment**: stale layers that settle
because adding feels safe and removing feels risky, until you must core down
through them to find what is still live.

Hunt **no-ops** sentence by sentence. An instruction the model already obeys by
default pays load to say nothing. The test, does it change behaviour versus the
default, is model-relative, not reader-relative. Two people disagreeing about a
no-op disagree about the default, and settle it by running the document, not by
debate. When a sentence fails, delete the whole sentence rather than trim words
from it. The test also grades leading words. A word too weak to beat the
default (_be thorough_ when the agent is already thorough-ish) is a no-op, and
the fix is a stronger word (_relentless_), not a different technique.
